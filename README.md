This is my first game project which I am proud to add to my portfolio. I have tried to replicate the same idea from the popular game "Zombie vs Plants".

The game assets has been taken from https://www.glitchthegame.com/downloads/. Big thanks to that organization for providing for developers with assets to practice make games.

Also want to thank mentors from Udemy course "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games" for their inspiration to make this game.

Besides implementing the basic functions I have added some of my own features like: tutorial for user, level progression design, boss level, implementing own difficulty logic, creating own "Game Over" scene, fixing all type of bugs.

That is the first project which I am really proud off. I have tried to make short, complete and dynamic game.

NOTE! The game does not support touch input only mouse input.
